		 <h2> What I like Most:<h2>
		 <h3>Nature</h3>
		<h3>Some points of nature:</h3>
		<p> Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the
		phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of
		science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other 
		natural phenomena.
		The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential
		qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth". In ancient philosophy, natura is 
		mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis, which originally related to the intrinsic 
		characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to develop of their own accord. The concept
		of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with 
		certain core applications of the word by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic 
		dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.
		During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality,
		organized and moved by divine laws. With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part 
		of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions 
		(Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). 
		However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially 
		after Charles Darwin.</p>
